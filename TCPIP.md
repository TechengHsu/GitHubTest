# Introduction to Computer Networks

> This handout only deals with the most basic topics about Computer Networks,
> please refer to EE3650/COM5310 for further information.
> If there's any problem with this file, please note me. Thank you.

## Prerequisites
* basic knowledge about HTML/JavaScript and better how they're executed on browsers
* knowing how to let files available on your own server/website
* (optional) programming language: C/C++
* (optional) hub/switch, router, port
* (optional) experience in PHP/MySQL, or setting up XAMP/LAMP, etc.


## Abstract 
This handout gives an introductory version of Computer Networks,
which is a useful subject/knowledge of great importance.
We'll first talk about the historical perspective of WWW,
giving us more insight into this interesting field,
and thus it provide us with the reason why we need this and how we do it.
We then turn our interest to Open System Interconnection (OSI), which is a very important concept
that results in today's TCP/IP and other network frameworks.
The main topic is IP and the overall structure of Internet (connections).
Finally, this handout will end up in something about UDP, DNS, TCP, etc.
