# Introduction to Computer Networks

> This handout only deals with the most basic topics about Computer Networks,
> please refer to EE3650/COM5310 for further information.
> If there's any problem with this file, please note me. Thank you.

## Prerequisites
* basic knowledge about HTML/JavaScript and better how they're executed on browsers
* knowing how to let files available on your own server/website
* (optional) programming language: C/C++
* (optional) hub/switch, router, port
* (optional) experience in PHP/MySQL, or setting up XAMP/LAMP, etc.


## Abstract 
This handout gives an introductory version of Computer Networks,
which is a useful subject/knowledge of great importance.
We'll first talk about the historical perspective of WWW,
giving us more insight into this interesting field,
and thus it provide us with the reason why we need this and how we do it.
We then turn our interest to Open System Interconnection (OSI), which is a very important concept
that results in today's TCP/IP and other network frameworks.
The main topic is IP and the overall structure of Internet (connections).
Finally, this handout will end up in something about UDP, DNS, TCP, etc.

## Topic 1 -- Historical Perspective
> Opening Questions: </br>
> What's the origin of "web"? </br>
> Why we have these networks protocol now? </br>
> What is a "server"? </br>
> Are there any standards regarding with various protocols? </br>


#### 1.1 Origination of World-Wide Web (WWW)
We now can see Internet everywhere in our lives, it may be surprising that
this is created/invented for military purposes during cold war times.
In the 1980's, incorporating TCP/IP protocols, a "net" of computers are able to communicate with each other.
The world-wide web (WWW) is then introduced to improve science researches.
That's the same time when HTTP is created to share researches among scientists.
Moreover, WWW and E-mail back in the 1980's and 1990's, respectively, made TCP/IP famous.
Interested reader can google "APARNET" for further information.

#### 1.2 "A Patch Server" -- Apache 
See HTTPd (HTTP daemon): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Httpd . 
Back then, in order to actuate the HTTP protocol,
NCSA designed HTTPd to use as server, and then Netscape initiated its own server and browser for users.
However, since the server of Netscape's was too expensive, the mainstream was HTTPd server.
As time went by, due to lack of update of HTTPd server,
a society issued a project to enhance/improve it, named it "A Patch Server",
nicknamed "Apache", meaning this is a server with lots of modification.

#### 1.3 IEEE Standards
Thanks to hakers, the standard for Internet and Ethernet was established by IEEE, remaining as the standard.
